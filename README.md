================

There are some times i try to implement basic algorithms, and keep them here. 


Samples: 
---- 
sorting: to implement a simple version of quick sort.   
       
InversionCounter: to count the inversions of a given array, which use a similar way of merge sort.   
I learn this from the course [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 at coursera.org]    

QuickSort_201406: 
step 1. another implement of the quick sort algorithm, an exercise  
from the course [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 at coursera.org]  
step 2. to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given  array, and the number of comparisons depends on which elements are chosen as pivots;
