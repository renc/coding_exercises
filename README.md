================

There are some times i try to implement basic algorithms, and keep them here. 


Samples:
  sorting: to implement a simple version of quick sort.
  
  InversionCounter: to count the inversions of a given array, which use a similar way of merge sort. 
  I learn this from the course [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 at coursera.org]
